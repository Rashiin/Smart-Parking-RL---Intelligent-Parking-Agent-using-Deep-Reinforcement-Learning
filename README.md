# Smart Parking RL - Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Parking

## 🚗 Overview
Smart Parking RL is a deep reinforcement learning project that simulates an intelligent parking agent navigating a grid environment with obstacles and designated parking spots. The agent is trained using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to find the shortest and safest path to park optimally.

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Design a realistic, grid-based parking environment
- Implement a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train a car agent
- Reward the agent for reaching valid parking spots
- Penalize for collisions or invalid parking
- Compare DQN vs BFS baseline path planning
- Visualize agent behavior via `pygame` and `matplotlib`
